<B>Your body</B><br>
 Drugs can have immediate and long-lasting effects on your physical health and well-being.<br>
<ul><li>Physical injuries:
When you’re under the influence of drugs, you might do things that you wouldn’t normally do.<img src="image/hab.gif" width="200" height="200" align="right"></img>
This can increase your chances of getting hurt or having an accident.<br>
Drug-related injuries can be from things like falling and car accidents.<br>

<li>Violence:
Some drugs can increase the likelihood of violent behavior.<br> 
Drug-induced violence can lead to serious injury to you and to others.<br>
<li>Internal damage:
Use of some drugs can damage your internal organs, like your liver, brain, lungs, throat and stomach.<br> 
E.g. Continuous marijuana use can harm the parts of the brain that control memory, attention and learning.<br>
<li>Pregnancy and STDs:
While you’re under the influence, you might be less likely to remember to have safe sex.<br> 
Unprotected sex can lead to pregnancy or the spread of STDs like HIV/AIDS.<br>

<li>Addiction:
When you take drugs, there’s a chance that you could become dependent on them. </ul>

<b>Your mental and emotional well-being</b><br>
Drug use can also alter your mood-when you’re high, and even when you’re not.<br> 
Drug use can make trigger stress or mental illness, or exacerbate already existing issues.<br>
<ul><li>Stress:
You might think that using certain drugs will help you relax and forget about the issues that cause stress.<br> 
But long-term drug use can have a big impact on the way your brain works, and lead to increased anxiety and stress.<br>
<li>Depression:
Feeling low after using some drugs-including alcohol-is common.<br> 
You might feel depressed because of the drug itself, or because of something that happened while you were using.<br> 
Sometimes people use drugs as a way to cope with their depression, but drug use can often worsen the feelings.<br>
<li>Mental illnesses:
Although scientists generally agree that there is a link between drug use and serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia,<br>
the National Institute on Drug Abuse says that it’s still unclear whether serious drug use leads to these illnesses.<br> 
or if having an illness increases a person’s chances to abuse drugs.<ul>
