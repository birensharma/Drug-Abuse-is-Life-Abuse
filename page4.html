                                                 Many people begin using drugs as a way to deal with stress and tension.<br> 
                                                 The reality is, however, that drugs are only a temporary fix. <br>
                                                 Finding coping methods such as exercise or meditation can eliminate the urge to try drugs.<br>
 <li><b>Seek therapy or counseling:</b><br>
                                Drug users often are people who are attempting to self-medicate for their psychological issues.<br> 
                              Working through problems with a mental health professional is a much more effective and long-lasting way of treating a psychological or emotional problem.<br>
 <li><b>Maintain a lifestyle that makes you happy:</b><br>
                                               Low self-esteem and depression are major triggers for drug abuse.<br> 
                                               Maintaining strong relationships and a healthy balance between physical and mental activity can help you.<br>
 <li><b>Be aware of your family’s history with substance abuse:</b><br>
                                                            If you know that you have a higher chance of becoming addicted, take extra precautions to avoid drugs and alcohol.<br>
                                                            It are much easier to avoid substances altogether than it is to recover from addiction.<br> 
                                                            No matter what your background or current situation is, it is possible to avoid slipping into the dangers of addiction.<br> 
 <img src="image/ef.png" width="500" height="200" align="left"></img<li><b>Exercise:</b><br>
                 Exercise releases endorphins, relieves stress, and promotes emotional well-being.<br> 
                 Try running in place, jumping rope, or walking around the block.<br>
 <li><b>Escaping:</b><br>
             Learn to avoid places, people, and situations where they might be tempted to use drugs.<br> 
             Prepare yourself for occasions where strangers may offer drugs to you.<br>
 <li><b>Look for consequences:</b><br>
                            Look at list of people who have been destroyed, even killed, by drugs.<br> 
                            For every rock star who looks cool taking drugs, there is one who is in rehab, or has died. We must take good decision.<br>  
 <li><b>Tell an adult about it:</b><br>
                             Make sure that you alert the appropriate person about the encounter .Give all details you can.
